1) Software Testing Concepts 		


Software : Set of instructions or programs to accomplish some task 

e.g whatsapp , calculator app etc ..

i) System softwares :

e.g Operating System , drivers etc 

ii) Programming Softwares

e.g compiler , interpreter ,debugging tools etc ..

iii) Application softwares 

e.g Web apps , mobile apps , stand alone , mainframe , silver lite , salesforce , SAP etc ..


what do we test in now-a-days apps ?

1)functionalities 
2) GUI Graphical user interface
3) usability
4) Performance 
5) Load 
6) Security 
7) Compatabilty

Testing :


It is a process of checking the developed software is working as per client business requirements or not.

->  to find defects 

the prime motto of testing is to deliver a quality and risk free product.

Terminolgies in Software testing :

1) Product

If a software application developed for multiple clients then it is product.

e.g 
NCR ==>ATM machine and s/w for HDFC,ICICI,kotak mahindra etc 
2) Project

If a software application developed for a specified client then it is project.

TCS ==> taking NCR product and customizing as per HDFC 

3) Error : Any incorrect human actions which gives wrong results .

If developer find the mistake in his testing 

4) Bug/Defect/Fault/Issue :

If the error is found by tester then it is called Bug/Defect/Fault/Issue.

5) Failure/Incident :

If the error is found by end user then it is called Failure/Incident.


Roles or Duties of Tester :

1) understanding application under test or Domain knowledge
2) Formal Testing (writing the test cases and executing)
3) Adhoc Testing (NO Test cases)
4) Report the defects to developers 
5) Retesting and Regression Testing
6) Develop and execute Automation scripts
7) Analyse the results 
8) publish test results


	Business Requirements 						Deploy

	HLD High Level Design					Integrate Units

	LLD Low Level Design					Builds   Units

Now-a-days Testing :

Testing is a process of checking are we developing right software or not and also
checking the developed software is working as per client business requirements or not.


			Software Testing = Verification + Validation
			
			
Software Testing Principles :

1) Exhaustive testing is impossible 
2) Defect Clustering 
3) Pesticide Paradox 
4) Early Testing 
5) Testing is application dependent and situation dependent
6) Testing should show presence of defects
7) Absence of defects is fallacy 


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) :

PM/TM/PL/TL  						Planing 							Project Play
																		Test Planing

									SDLC	Models
									
									
			1) Sequential 								2) Incremental 
				- Waterfall									- RAD model
				- V model									- Prototype
															- Spiral
															- Agile 
									
									
									
Waterfall :

- small projects 
- once completion of each phase , the phase get freezed (not to be edited)
- If requirements are clear then choose Waterfall model 

V- Model :

Verification and Validation Model

- small projects
- If requirements are not clear then choose V model 


RAD model : Rapid Application Development Model 

- Big Project 
- To be completed on short span of time 

e.g : Insurance project

where Auto Insurance , Health Insurance , Fire Insurance , Renters Insurance are independent of each other



Prototype Model : 

- Big projects 
- Here client doesn't have clear requirements and propose some reference application			
			
e.g : Zomato (Food delivery app) refering to Swiggy
			
Spiral Model :

-Big projects
- If there is dependency on requirements then go for Spiral Model 

e.g Banking Project (HDFC )
here Bill pay module depends on Funds Transfer
	 Funds Transfer depends on Accounts

				- Reviews 								- Unit Testing
					i) Requirements Reviews				- Intergration Testing 
					ii) Project plan reviews			- System Testing
					iii) Design Reviews 				- UAT Testing (User Acceptance Testing)
					iv) Code Reviews 
					v) Test Case Reviews
				
				- Walk Throughs 
				    i) KT Sessions 
					
Formal Reviews  : 					


If a review activity carried out using proper documentaation or checklist then it is called Formal review.


Inspection :

If a review activity carried out during execution of task then it is called Inspection.

Audit : 					

If a review activity carried out after execution of task then it is called Audit .

InFormal Review : 

If a review activity carried out without documentaation or checklist then it is called InFormal review.


i) Requirements Reviews	:

Business Analysts / Sales Team / Domain or Subject Matter Experts 

ii) Project plan reviews
     - Project plan   (Project Manager / Delivery Manager)
	 - Master test plan  (Test Manager / Lead Principal QA )

iii) Design Reviews
      - System Design ( System Architect / Solution Architect)
	  - UX Design ( Lead UX designer)
iv) Code Reviews 
     Senoir Developer / Lead Developer
v) Test Case Reviews
		Test Lead / Test Manager
		
Peer Reviews : Reviews carried out by peers (same level)

Unit Testing :  Developers 

a smallest part of the application (a method / function / procedure) to be tested 


Intergration Testing  : Devlopers 

After integrating the units, testing done on  method / function / procedure is called Intergration testing .

System Testing : 

Testing the app once the source code is compiled and deployed in a Server or System .



Functional System Testing Types :


1) Smoke Testing 

A quick test or rough test perfomed on new build  to verify major functionalities are working and also
application stability or consistencency .


2) Formal Testing 

3) Retesting 

The process of checking the bug is resolved in modified build is called ReTEsting .

4) Regression Testing

The process of checking the functionalities having any side effects because of code fix in modified build.

5) Sanity Testing  (subset of regression )

The process of checking the functionalities (subset of regression) in modified build (Preproduction or production build)

6) Priorty based testing 

If a formal testing performed based on priority of test cases .

Here they will mention which one to execute first , next and which one to be executed last.


7)End-to-End Testing 

Performing testing on stable builds to verify combination of journeys or functionalities

Special Functional System Testing Types :

8) BenchMark testing 

9) Exploratory Testing 

10) Monkey or Gorilla Testing (Adhoc- No test cases)

==========================================================================

Non-Functional System Testing Types :

1) UI or GUI Graphical User Interface Testing

to checking the alignmnet of web elements (textbox ,buttons , radio button etc ..)
spelling checking , color checking etc ..

2) Usability testing 

to check the user friendliness of the system / application 

3) Performance 

Responsiveness 
Stability 

i) Response time
ii) Processing time 
iii) User volume data 

Load Testing : 

-> Stress Testing 
-> Spike Testing 
-> Soak Testing 
-> Data volume testing 

4) Security Testing 

Encription
Cookies injection 

5) Globalization or Internationalization or I18N Testing

6) Localization or L10N testing 

7) Recovery Testing 

8) Installation testing 

9) UnInstallation testing 

------------------------------------------
UAT or User Acceptance Testing

Alpha Testing :

Testing carried out at company premises 


Beta Testing :


Testing carried out at client prmises

Test Planning          

Test Strategy  : It's a high level document which tells about the testing activities carried out for a project.

Test plan : 

It's a detailed document which tells about the testing activities carried out for a project.
