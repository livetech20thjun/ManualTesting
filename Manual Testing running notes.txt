1) Software Testing Concepts 		


Software : Set of instructions or programs to accomplish some task 

e.g whatsapp , calculator app etc ..

i) System softwares :

e.g Operating System , drivers etc 

ii) Programming Softwares

e.g compiler , interpreter ,debugging tools etc ..

iii) Application softwares 

e.g Web apps , mobile apps , stand alone , mainframe , silver lite , salesforce , SAP etc ..


what do we test in now-a-days apps ?

1)functionalities 
2) GUI Graphical user interface
3) usability
4) Performance 
5) Load 
6) Security 
7) Compatabilty

Testing :


It is a process of checking the developed software is working as per client business requirements or not.

->  to find defects 

the prime motto of testing is to deliver a quality and risk free product.

Terminolgies in Software testing :

1) Product

If a software application developed for multiple clients then it is product.

e.g 
NCR ==>ATM machine and s/w for HDFC,ICICI,kotak mahindra etc 
2) Project

If a software application developed for a specified client then it is project.

TCS ==> taking NCR product and customizing as per HDFC 

3) Error : Any incorrect human actions which gives wrong results .

If developer find the mistake in his testing 

4) Bug/Defect/Fault/Issue :

If the error is found by tester then it is called Bug/Defect/Fault/Issue.

5) Failure/Incident :

If the error is found by end user then it is called Failure/Incident.


Roles or Duties of Tester :

1) understanding application under test or Domain knowledge
2) Formal Testing (writing the test cases and executing)
3) Adhoc Testing (NO Test cases)
4) Report the defects to developers 
5) Retesting and Regression Testing
6) Develop and execute Automation scripts
7) Analyse the results 
8) publish test results

Now-a-days Testing :

Testing is a process of checking are we developing right software or not and also
checking the developed software is working as per client business requirements or not.


			Software Testing = Verification + Validation
			
			
Software Testing Principles :

1) Exhaustive testing is impossible 
2) Defect Clustering 
3) Pesticide Paradox 
4) Early Testing 
5) Testing is application dependent and situation dependent
6) Testing should show presence of defects
7) Absence of defects is fallacy
